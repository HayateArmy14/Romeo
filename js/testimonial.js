Service might be slow on busy days but is very polite and the lobster pasta was probably the best Iâ€™ve ever had!!! They offer free individual ice creams for dessert and children and pets are more than welcome :-)",

Right at the beginning of the seaside promenade of Romeikos Gialos,(one of the two natural bays of the town) far from the noise and bustle of the cafes and restaurants on this promenade.The best sitting places of this restaurant are..either on the dock next to the sea or at a little natural 'balcony' with just a few tables with the best of views.The service was a bit slow,but the food was very good with big portions and perfect prices.       I will visit it again when I come back to the island.",

If there was one criticism it would be that the portion sizes were always huge. Consider sharing even the main courses. If we return to Limnos it will be at the top of our list.",
